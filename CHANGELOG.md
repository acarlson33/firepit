## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-29

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Node.js 20.9.0 minimum** - Enforced via the engines field in package.json.
- **Next.js 16.2.x** - Updated Next.js ecosystem packages; align your app/runtime and CI accordingly.
- **Appwrite TablesDB** - Added TablesDB client for transaction support (notably report resolution flow), which may affect Appwrite API behavior assumptions in custom integrations.

### ✨ Features

#### Profile Backgrounds and Avatar Frames

- **Custom profile backgrounds** - Solid colors, gradients, or uploaded images with a 24-hour cooldown per user
- **Preset avatar frames** - Seasonal and themed frames with admin-configurable assets
- **Profile appearance settings** - In-app UI for selecting backgrounds, frames, and previewing changes

#### User Reporting System

- **Report users** - Report users for inappropriate profile content with required justification
- **Admin reports dashboard** - Instance admins can review, resolve, or dismiss reports with audit logging
- **Rate limiting** - DB-backed rate limiting prevents report spam (5 per hour per user)
- **Atomic report resolution** - Transaction-based resolution prevents double-processing of reports

#### Onboarding Improvements

- **Safe form validation** - Type-guarded formData parsing with proper fallbacks
- **Notification settings** - Onboarding now correctly sets notification preferences

### Build and Infrastructure

- **Runtime/tooling alignment** - CI and production runtime checks now enforce the upgraded framework/runtime baseline
- **Transaction-backed moderation flow** - Report resolution path now uses Appwrite transactions to prevent double-processing

### Bug Fixes

- **Profile background clearing** - Fixed clearing not working for color/gradient backgrounds
- **Background type switching** - Fixed image file ID not being cleared when switching to color/gradient
- **Moderation toast grammar** - Fixed "Successfully kickned" → "Successfully kicked"
- **Fixed upload endpoints leaking raw exceptions to clients** - Generic error messages returned to clients instead of raw exceptions
- **File ownership on delete** - Upload delete endpoints now verify file ownership before deletion
- **Inbox query fix** - Fixed `Query.equal` on array attribute `participants` → `Query.contains`
- **PostHog deduplication** - Removed duplicate initialization in `instrumentation-client.ts` and the PostHog provider component to prevent "already initialized" warnings
